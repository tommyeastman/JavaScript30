#Working with Arrays
filter, map, sort, and reduce are 4 methods which can be run on arrays.
These methods will iterate over an array.

filter - subset - pass in row index
map - lapply - pass in row index
sort - pass in 2 row indexes to compare. need to actually compare row indexes and
assign values of 1 and -1 to sort the array.
reduce - can use to sum variables, create frequencies, etc. need to understand more.
don't understand second argument passed to reduce.

have created temporary variables within the methods, but need to figure out how to create
an additional variable (technically, an additional property for all elements in the array)

Split a string into 2 new variables:
const[aLast,aFirst]=a.split(' ,');
